# Tackling Sexual Transmitted Disease Prevalence in the United States
**Analysis on the Effectiveness of State-Level Policies to Prevent Sexual Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in Georgia, Maryland, and New York**

## Project Description
Sexual Transmitted Diseases (STDs) have an imprint on every fabric of human life, dating all the way back to early civilization. Millions of individuals around the world have been diagnosed with at least one form of STDs. Like the rest of the globe, in the United States, these viruses and infections are having a significant impact on not only the national economy, but on the entire healthcare system. Therefore, noting that these diseases had been significantly reduced during the 1990s and have made an unfortunate comeback within US society, US medical professionals and government officials are seeking policy changes that can change this recent national trajectory. Through our analysis, we analyzed three states that passed legislation on this topic: Maryland (2015), New York (2016), and Georgia (2017). This project and repo is a holistic overview of this health crisis and our motivation, methods used, considerations and assumptions made, and our findings.

It is worth noting that while we believe our analysis is complete, further research into each respective set of reference states is required to ensure they are truly representative of the selected state they act as controls for. In addition, the limitations we experienced should be addressed and the analysis conducted should be further built upon. Therefore, we would highly encourage stakeholders to use our findings as a starting point on this topic.

## Data
This project consists of data collected from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
All associated data files (analyzed by disease type, race, gender, and age group) are provided in the source repository `00_Source_Data`.

## Report Summary
To summarize our findings, after analyzing the data and difference-in-difference analysis from Maryland, New York, and Georgia, we can contend that from the implemented policies, the sole policy constituted within Georgia was the only effective law. Within the state of Georgia, we observed a slight reduction in the rate of increase for overall STDs and chlamydia, but the sought-after impact for gonorrhea rates, which observed a more pronounced decrease in STD rate. Unlike Georgia, it can be stated that the policies implemented within New York and Maryland were ineffective in reducing the overall rate of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) per 100,000 individuals. The STD rate per 100,000 individuals continued to increase for these two treatment states at a higher rate than even their respective control states, despite the policy interventions.

## How-To-Get-Started Guide
Open your terminal and run the following lines in order: 

1. `git clone git@github.com:MIDS-at-Duke/unifying-data-science-2023-project-ids701-group-10.git`

2. `cd 10_code`

From here you'll be able to run any of notebooks in the repository without any trouble *(with the exception of changing directory of source data).*
